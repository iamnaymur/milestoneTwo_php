## Php = Hypertext preprocessor and it runs on the server.

Php is not case sensitive, though it is case sensitive for the variable declarations.
The (.) dot is used for concatenation purposes

### Variable rules -

1 . Start; with $
2 . can not use special character in it.
3 . Can not use numbers at the beginning.

### Constants -

Mainly variable and constants both are the same but there is a bit difference between them. And that is the same as let and const as we knew in javascript, that the value in let can be reassigned but the const cannot and here it is the same with variable and constants. Variable can be reassigned but the constant cannot.

### Data types

1 . String,
2 . Integer, (What we call number in javascript)
3 . Float, (floating point numbers- also called double)
4 . Boolean,
5 . array,
6 . object,
7 . null,
8 . resource, ( Represents a reference to an external resource, such as a database connection or a file handle.)

### Loops

1 . 'for' loop,
2 . 'while' loop,
3 . 'do-while' loop,
4 . 'for-each' loop,
5 . 'break' - (Used to exit a loop prematurely when a certain condition is met. )
6 . 'continue' - (Skips the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next iteration.)


#### Array
-In php the array() is used to create a new array. Examples are given on the code file. There are mainly three types of arrays in php.

1 . INDEXED array, (index gets assigned automatically as we saw in javascript and starts with 0.)
2 . ASSOCIATIVE array, (Associative arrays are arrays that use named keys that you assign to them.)
3 . MULTIDIMENSIONAL array. (A multidimensional array is an array containing one or more arrays.)



### Session
A PHP session is used to store data on a server rather than the computer of the user. Session identifiers or SID is a unique number which is used to identify every user in a session based environment.
